                This website serves as a portfolio for the knowledge and skills I've acquired throughout my years.
                Starting on Java, the first major programming language that made <Tooltip>me</Tooltip> design software in a object-oriented manner.
                Then, following it up with Javascript, I learned both front-end and back-end development and how the two should operate together, with it also learning HTML, CSS and NodeJS.
